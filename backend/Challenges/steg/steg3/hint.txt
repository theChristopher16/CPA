The password isn't here! However, I do have some fun facts! Did you know that the world's oldest dog, Bluey, lived to be 29 years old? Despite being the first record holder, that's nothing compared to Cream Puff the cat, who lived to a whopping 38 years old! She died very recently in 2005. Maybe old Bluey and Cream Puff could help you uncover the hidden password elsewhere...
